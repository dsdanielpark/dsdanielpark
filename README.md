### *Currently in progress...*
Large language models are expected to expand into various fields and modalities. However, limited resources pose challenges for individual researchers to undertake projects. I am currently working on a project using the Foundation LLM model to create task-specific models. Additionally, I eagerly await connections from individuals interested in collaborative research or offering resource support.

### *Where there’s a will, there’s a way.*
I am training to become a insightful developer and a skillful and quick-witted engineer. <br>
I believe that someday, all the knowledge I've acquired will come together at the end of the journey.
