### *Where there’s a will, there’s a way.*
I am training to become a insightful developer and a skillful and quick-witted engineer. <br>
I believe that someday, all the knowledge I've acquired will come together at the end of the journey.


### *Projects*
  
  | Project | Description |
  |:--|:--|
  | GPT-BERT-Medical-QA-Chatbot| Medical domain-focused GPT-2 fine-tuning, optimization, and lightweighting research repository (compared to GPT-4). <br> [[Github]](https://github.com/DSDanielPark/medical-qa-bert-chatgpt) |
  | Korean-news-topic-classification-using-KO-BERT | Model for classifying Korean news articles into eight pre-defined categories using a fine-tuned Korean BERT news article classifier. <br> [[Github]](https://github.com/DSDanielPark/fine-tuned-korean-bert-news-article-classifier) |
  | Multi-objective-recommender | Recommendation system model based on e-commerce log data that utilizes ranking and re-ranking techniques. The model aims to improve the accuracy of product recommendations by incorporating user behavior data such as click-through rates and purchase history. <br> [[GitHub]](https://github.com/DSDanielPark/kaggle2023-multi-objective-recommender)|
  
I have experience in working on a variety of projects, including analyzing and modeling data from the Korean National Health Insurance Corporation's cohort, CT and MRI-related projects, real estate price prediction for KB Financial Group, extracting key factors from Hyundai Motor Group's engineering drawings using various algorithms developed through image processing and OCR models, data processing projects using PySpark and Hadoop, and analyzing blood and hair metabolites of pets. I also have experience in planning and securing business projects. However, since these projects were developed for commercial purposes, no information is publicly disclosed.
